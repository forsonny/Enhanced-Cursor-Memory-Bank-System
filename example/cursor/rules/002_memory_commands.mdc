# Memory Commands

This rule defines the command interface for directly interacting with the memory system. These commands provide explicit control over memory operations, adapted for Cursor's environment.

## Command Syntax

All memory commands use the `/memory` prefix followed by the specific operation:

```
/memory <command> [arguments]
```

## Available Commands

### Core Commands

- `/memory init` - Initialize the memory system for a new project
  - Checks if memory files and structure exist
  - Provides instructions for creating necessary files if they don't exist
  - Guides through initial setup process

- `/memory status` - Display current memory system status
  - Shows configuration information
  - Lists available memory files
  - Reports current mode
  - Indicates initialization status

- `/memory help` - Show available memory commands and usage
  - Displays command list with descriptions
  - Provides examples of common usage

### Memory Management

- `/memory save <context>` - Save current information to specified memory context
  - Example: `/memory save architecture` to update architecture memory
  - Options: Add `-t` flag for temporary (short-term) storage
  - Implementation: Provides text for the user to add to the specified memory file

- `/memory recall <context>` - Retrieve information from specified memory context
  - Example: `/memory recall patterns` to view established patterns
  - Options: Add `-v` flag for verbose output with metadata
  - Implementation: Requests user to open specified file and then reads its content

- `/memory update <file> <content>` - Update specific memory file
  - Example: `/memory update decisions.md "Decision: We will use TypeScript for all new code"`
  - Implementation: Provides formatted text for the user to add to the specified file

- `/memory search <query>` - Search across memory for relevant information
  - Example: `/memory search authentication`
  - Options: Add `-c <context>` to limit search to specific memory context
  - Implementation: Requests user to open relevant files, then searches their content

### Memory Organization

- `/memory promote <source>` - Promote short-term memory to long-term
  - Example: `/memory promote working_decisions.md`
  - Options: Add `-d <destination>` to specify target file
  - Implementation: Suggests content to move from short-term to long-term memory

- `/memory archive <file>` - Archive memory that's no longer actively relevant
  - Example: `/memory archive old_patterns.md`
  - Implementation: Provides instructions for moving file to archive location

- `/memory consolidate <files>` - Combine related memories into a cohesive document
  - Example: `/memory consolidate auth_*.md authentication.md`
  - Implementation: Requests access to source files, then provides consolidated content

### Configuration

- `/memory config <key> <value>` - Update memory system configuration
  - Example: `/memory config short_term.retention 7d`
  - Implementation: Provides the JSON to update in config.json

- `/memory toggle <feature>` - Enable/disable specific memory features
  - Example: `/memory toggle auto_recall`
  - Implementation: Provides the configuration change to implement

## Command Execution Protocol

Due to Cursor's environment, memory commands follow this execution protocol:

1. **Command Parsing**: I interpret the command and its arguments
2. **File Access Request**: If needed, I request access to required files
   - "To process this command, I need to see the content of [file]. Can you open it?"
3. **Operation Planning**: I determine what changes are needed
4. **User Confirmation**: I describe the proposed changes and ask for confirmation
   - "I'll update [file] by adding [content]. Would you like me to proceed?"
5. **Implementation Guidance**: I provide specific instructions for implementation
   - "Please add the following content to [file]:"
6. **Operation Verification**: I confirm when the operation is complete
   - "The memory has been successfully updated."
7. **Action Summary and Next Steps**: Provide a structured completion report with options
   - Include completion summary, command options, and suggested next steps

## Command Response Format

When a memory command is executed, the response follows this format:

```
MEMORY COMMAND: <command>
STATUS: <success|planning|failure>
DETAILS: <relevant details about operation>
ACTION NEEDED: <what the user needs to do>
NEXT STEPS: <suggested follow-up actions>
```

## Command Shortcuts

Quick access shortcuts for common operations:

- `/ms` - Alias for `/memory status`
- `/mr <context>` - Alias for `/memory recall <context>`
- `/mu <file> <content>` - Alias for `/memory update <file> <content>`

## Command Authorization

All memory commands are available in any operational mode, but some have mode-specific behaviors:

- Save operations in Review mode include review metadata
- Update operations in Implement mode include implementation details
- Consolidate operations in Think mode include decision reasoning

## Command Help System

Each command provides contextual help with the `-h` flag:

```
/memory save -h

COMMAND: /memory save <context>
DESCRIPTION: Saves current information to specified memory context
ARGUMENTS:
  <context> - Target memory context (required)
OPTIONS:
  -t - Store as temporary (short-term) memory
  -m <message> - Add descriptive message
EXAMPLES:
  /memory save architecture
  /memory save patterns -t
  /memory save decisions -m "Updated authentication approach"
```

## User-Driven Events

Since automatic event detection isn't possible, memory commands also support user-driven event reporting:

- `/memory event <type> <details>` - Report a development event
  - Example: `/memory event commit "Implemented user authentication"`
  - Implementation: Updates appropriate memory files based on event type

Common event types:
- `commit` - Code committed to repository
- `build` - Build completed (success/failure)
- `test` - Tests run (success/failure)
- `create` - New file created
- `modification` - File modified
- `branch` - Git branch changed

## Command-Specific Behaviors

### Core Memory Commands Behavior

For `/memory status`:
1. Request access to config.json if needed
2. Display initialization status, current mode, available memory files, and recent activities
3. Format response using the STATUS format
4. Suggest next steps based on system state

For `/memory help`:
1. List available commands with brief descriptions
2. Group commands by category 
3. Provide usage examples for common commands
4. No file access needed

### Memory Management Behavior

For `/memory save`:
1. Request user to identify information to save

3. Provide complete content to add
4. Ask for confirmation after updating

For `/memory recall`:

2. Read content when provided
3. Acknowledge receiving content
4. Reference key points in subsequent responses

For `/memory update`:
1. Generate properly formatted content for the specified file
2. Provide complete update text

1. Acknowledge the event
2. Identify affected memory files based on event type
3. Generate appropriate updates for each file
4. Provide formatted content
5. Ask for confirmation after updates

### Command Shortcuts Behavior

For command shortcuts:
1. Interpret shortcuts identically to their full command counterparts
2. Acknowledge using shortcut in response

## Completion Response Structure

After completing any command or set of actions, I will always conclude with:

```
## Action Report
- **Completed:** [List of completed actions]
- **Status:** [Success/Partial/Failed]
- **Files Affected:** [List of files updated or referenced]

## Available Commands
- `/command1` - [Brief description]
- `/command2` - [Brief description]
[2-3 relevant commands for current context]

- **THINK Mode**: Emphasize exploration commands and documenting discoveries
- **PLAN Mode**: Emphasize plan validation, refinement, and task breakdowns
- **IMPLEMENT Mode**: Emphasize progress tracking and checkpointing work
- **REVIEW Mode**: Emphasize improvement identification and documenting findings
- **DOCUMENT Mode**: Emphasize documentation completion and consistency checks
